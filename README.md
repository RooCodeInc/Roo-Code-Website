This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and lives at https://roocode.com.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
