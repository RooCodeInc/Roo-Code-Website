## Introduction

At RooCode, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our AI-powered coding assistant and related services.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using RooCode, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all the terms outlined in this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information

We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when creating an account, such as your name, email address, and payment information.

### Usage Data

We collect anonymous usage data to improve our services, including feature usage patterns, performance metrics, and error reports. This data is aggregated and does not contain personally identifiable information.

### Code and Project Data

RooCode processes your code locally on your machine. By default, your code is not sent to our servers or stored by us. When you explicitly choose to use cloud-based features, minimal code snippets may be temporarily processed in our secure cloud environment with end-to-end encryption.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve RooCode services
- Process transactions and manage your account
- Send you technical notices, updates, and support messages
- Respond to your comments and questions
- Monitor and analyze usage patterns and trends
- Protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other illegal activities

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, accidental loss, alteration, or disclosure.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

You can request deletion of your account and associated personal information at any time by contacting our support team.

## Third-Party Services

RooCode may use third-party services for analytics, payment processing, and customer support. These services may collect, use, and disclose your information according to their own privacy policies.

We carefully select our third-party service providers and require them to respect your privacy and maintain appropriate security measures.

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Access the personal information we hold about you
- Correct inaccurate or incomplete information
- Request deletion of your personal information
- Restrict or object to certain processing activities
- Request a copy of your data in a portable format
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent

To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Us" section.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of RooCode after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
